# SLIME RPG

This is an unfinished game that I worked on when I was first learning Python.

The purpose of building it was to apply the knowledge gained from courses I was taking online. I moved on to other projects that were more relevant to what I was learning without finishing this one, but I'd like to get back to this some day.

To run, install the required packages from `requirements.txt`. Then, run `python main.py`. There are a few scenes to walk through, a couple of which are hidden!

There is also an incomplete opening scene, which can be viewed by running `python opening.py`.
